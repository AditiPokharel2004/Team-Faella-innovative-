            whispered, “I'll always find you, no matter what.”




            Ella's love and determination brought Max back home safely. They hugged tightly, both feeling grateful and

            relieved.</h4>

            worried he might scuff them. He stayed home from the playground, watching his friends play and laugh.




            One day, his mom said, “These shoes are made for adventures, just like you.” With a deep breath,

            Sam put on his shoes and joined his friends.




            He played joyfully, realizing that enjoying life was more important than keeping his shoes clean.

            At the end of the day, his shoes were a bit dirty, but his heart was full of happiness.</h4>

            and laughed together.

            Liam realized that the rain didn’t ruin their fun—it made their day special in a different way.




            When they returned home, Liam hugged Mia and said, “Thanks for showing me how to find joy in the rain.”</h4>
